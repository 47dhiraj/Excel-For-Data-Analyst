    Argument            Description

    lookup_value:       This specifies the value that you want to look up in our data.
    table_array:        This is the area/location where the values are present in excel.
    col_index_number:   This specifies the column number from where we need to return the value.
    range_lookup:       This has two options; if the value is set to FALSE, that means we are looking for an exact match. If the value is TRUE, then we are looking for an approximate match.
