    4. Click "OK" to create the pivot table.

    5. In the pivot table fields pane, you'll see a list of all the columns in your data set. Now, drag and drop the columns you want to summarize into the "Rows" section and drag and drop other columns into the "Values" section of the pivot table fields pane.



    NOTE : If you need extra value field settings or rename the Custom Name then, simply left click on Custom field name of "Values" section and choose "Value Field Settings" option and now u can do the custom settings according to your requirement.

# Example :

Let's say you have a sales data set that includes the following columns: Country, State, Revenue, Cost, Profit, Year, Customer_Gender  etc. 

==> For eg(available in Sheet 1): you want to create a pivot table, that summarizes total revenue, total cost and total profit by each country and their each state.

OR

==> For eg(available in Sheet 3): you want to create a pivot table, that summarizes total revenue of each country by every year.
