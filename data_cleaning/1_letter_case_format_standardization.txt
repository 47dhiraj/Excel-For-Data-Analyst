# Format Standardization :

    ==> Formatting case of the letters
    ==> Removing unnecessary spaces
    ==> Checking spelling error
    ==> making currency to their base value
    ==> Most of the time, Date can cause issues.


# How to change the case of all the cells values of any column ?

    ==> At first create new column, just behind that column which case u want to change.

    ==> So, suppose, u want to make all the letters capital,

    ==> Then, in one cell of that newly created column, write a following formula:
            
            SYNTAX:
                =UPPER(start cell:end cell)
                    OR
                =LOWER(start cell:end cell)
                    OR
                =PROPER(start cell:end cell)

            Example:
                =UPPER(C2:C47)
                    OR
                =LOWER(C2:C47)
                    OR
                =PROPER(C2:C47)


    ==> Then, u will see alphabets of the cell being changed to either capital or small case.
    ==> Now, select that changed cell (eg: D2) to the last cell of range (eg: D47) ie D2:D47.

    ==> Now, press "Ctrl + D" or "Ctrl + Enter".

    ==> Now, u will see all cells value being changed to your desired case.
