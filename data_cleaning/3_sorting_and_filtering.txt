==> First select all the data or any column, in which u want to apply filter.
==> Click "Data" option on the Excel Ribbon tab.
==> Then, Click "Filter" option.

==> Now u can do some filtering or even sorting any column:

    ==> By selecting only specific column to correct/filter something wrong.

    ==> In similar way like above, u can fix the errors this is present on any column.

    ==> U can use same filtering technique to check if something is Blank in the dataset.

NOTE: U can always clear the filter after u are done, playing with filter.
